        <h1>Autonomous Vehicle</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="project-update">
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> This was a project done by 3 people to convert a basic RC Car with just a motor, servo, and battery into an Autonomous Vehicle. Some notable components that allowed for this conversion are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Camera that can output video</li>
                    <li>NVIDIA Jetson Nano</li>
                    <li>VESC (Variable/Vedder Electric Speed Controller)</li>
                </ul>
                To attach these components onto the car, we laser cut an acrylic plate with holes to route wires and then 3D printed supports for the plate along with housing for the electrical components.
                Once connected, we were able to ssh into the Jetson Nano which uses a form linux as its OS and code directly on it. One of the first things we did was use a software called <a href="https://www.donkeycar.com/">DonkeyCar</a>
                to do machine learning using images taken from the camera as we manually drove the RC Car around a track with a game controller. After multiple attempts of gathering data and training, we were able to
                get some sub-par results. We think this was due to the track being reflective of sunlight which made gathering good data difficult. Our next 2 projects with the car used Python, OpenCV, and an API
                that interacts with our VESC to autonomously drive the car using computer vision</p>

            <h2>Three Autonomous Laps using Python and OpenCV</h2>
            <p>To accomplish this project, I used OpenCV to filter the video feed and detect lane lines on both sides of the car.
                From that, I would receive two lines in which I calculated the bisector whose angle would be used to steer our car. The following video shows 3 autonomous laps using this method.

            <h2>Wildlife Conservation Protocol</h2>
            <p>Another fun project we did was using object detection to adjust driving behavior. For the object detection I used the COCO (Common objects in context) 
                pre-trained model in order to detect animals such as a raccoon and pedestrians. This combined with a simple form of distance estimation, I am able to program the different
            behaviors according to the object immediately in front of the vehicle seen in the video below. Enjoy!</p>

        <h1>Path Tracer</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="project-update">
            <p>During the spring of 2022, I created a path tracer for my computer graphics class. I started with a 
                raytracer using Peter Shirley's <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a> as a guide.
                After having a good foundation, I implemented a variety of upgrades and features such as direct lighting, indirect lighting with path tracing
                , and multiple importance sampling. Please enjoy a few samples of the results.

        <h1>Shadow Mapping</h1>
        <div class="project-update">
            <h2>What is shadow mapping?</h2>
            <p>Like the name suggests, shadow mapping is a technique used in computer graphics to generate shadows
                Why shadow mapping?
Firstly, shadows make things look more realistic, gives dimensions of depth, and just looks cool.
In ray tracing realistic shadows are much easier to implement, rays are shot from the camera and when they intersect with objects, it is easy to detect if the object is occluded by a light source.
However, given the computing time of ray tracing, how can we get shadows using a rasterizer instead?
This is where shadow mapping comes in. it allows for the real time generation of shadows using a rasterizer.
            </p>

        <div class="project-update">
            <h2>Progress - Part 1</h2>
            <p>First, I created a fragment shader that would color the scene based on depth values. In this case the renderings are from the camera’s 
                Perspective. To generate final image on the right, I had to linearize 
                the depth between two closer points (near and far) to create a nice gradient rather than the image on the left which assigns depth value based off unmodified z-coordinates in window space.
            </p>

        <div class="project-update">
            <h2>Progress - Part 2</h2>
            <p>Since in this project, there is only one light source (the “sun”) which is a directional source as opposed to a point source, I used an orthographic projection for the light’s projection. Using this, I created the left image by rendering the scene with the depth shader fragment from the POV of the Light source (ie. drawing the scene in light space). 
                After this, I combine the two passes by setting up a depth map frame buffer object and depth map, then using the first pass to generate the depth map and store that into a texture. Then passing this texture to the second rendering pass to allow for the calculation of shadows in a separate fragment shader. The right image is a result from this. Next, is to add back in the Phong shading for color. I combined the two by multiplying the shadow (which is 0 for occluded and 1 for not occluded) to the specular and diffuse parts of the Phong shading, the ambient lighting is left alone. 
            </p>

        <div class="project-update">
            <h2>Progress - Part 3 - Dealing with artifacts</h2>
            <p>
                After adding back in the Phong shading, I get the image on the left which contains a shadow mapping artifact called shadow acne. The acne occurs on surfaces not occluded and is caused by the limited resolution of the shadow map and sampling of fragments overlapping. This makes it so that the surface is constant casting a shadow on itself. To fix this, a small bias can be added which offsets the depth of surfaces to make it slightly closer to the light when doing the shadow map comparison. Fixed image is on the right

            </p>
            <img src="./projects/shadow-mapping-images/progress3.0.png">
            <img src="./projects/shadow-mapping-images/progress3.1.png">
            <p>
                Another artifact is aliasing, which causes the edges of shadows to be pixelated and jagged. The method I used to attempt to fix this is called Poisson Sampling. Which essentially samples the depth map multiple times in a small area around  each fragment rather than only sampling the same location

                Project Eucalyptus is a bullet journalling web application that aims to give users an online alternative to bullet journaling.
                This project was created in a 10 week span in a collaborative effort with my peers. I programmed and helped design many aspects of the projects' frontend
                (using Javascript, HTML, and css) like the side navigation bar and timespan format menu.</br><br>

            <h2>What is Mad Martians?</h2>
            <p>
                Mad Martians is a 3D, 4-player co-op tower defense game inspired by games like <i><b>Orcs Must Die</b></i> and <i><b>Dungeon Defenders 2</b></i>. <br><br>

                It was built from scratch by 7 people in 10 weeks
                using C++, OpenGL, and a few other libraries for audio and networking. My role within this project involved working on the rendering/graphics engine where I parsed data coming from the game server
                and rendered the game objects on the client. Lighting was done using Blinn-Phong Shading. I was also involved in creating physics based particle effects along with creating simple animations in the graphics shaders. This was one of the most
                fun experiences I've had as a software developer and I hope you take look at our creation.

                <h2>Animation Engine</h2>
                The animation engine takes in three inputs: the skeleton, skin, and animation. First it loads a character skeleton from a custom .skel file and displays it in 3D.
            All joints in the skeleton are implemented as 3-DOF rotational joints (ball-and-socket joints). The program performs the forward kinematics computations to generate world space matrices for the joints.
            Then it loads the character skin from a .skin file and attaches it to the skeleton. Finally, it loads a keyframe animation from an .anim file and plays it back on a skinned character. The .anim file contains an array of channels, each channel containing an array of keyframes.
