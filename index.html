            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This was a group project (me and two peers) for my Introduction to Autonoumous Vehicles class. 
                At the beginning of the course we were given a box of components and the skeleton of an RC Car with a motor. Some of the notable components included
                a camera, an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and a VESC (Variable/Vedder Electric Speed Cotroller). The first task was to design and 3D print parts that would
                allow the components to be mounted on skeleton car. We kept it simple and lasercut an acrylic plate with holes for mounting and 3D printed legs for the plate
                as well as cases for the Jetson Nano and camera. Once all the parts fit together, we had to begin building our circuit which included soldering wires
                and connecting the correect connectors. Once everything was receiving power, we configured our VESC to ensure that our future program can control the motor with no issues</p>

            <h2>Three Autonoumous Laps using Python and OpenCV</h2>
            <p>One of the projects we created with our car was to have it drive around a track autonomously. First, I used OpenCV to detect lane lines on both sides of the car.
                From that, I would receive two lines in which I calculated the Bisector which would be used to steer our car. The following video shows 3 autonoumous laps using this method.

            <p>Another fun project we did was using object detection to adjust driving behavior. For the object detection I used the COCO (Common objects in context) 
                pre trained model in order to detect animals such as a raccoon and pedestrians. This combined with a simple form of distance estimation, I am able to program the different 
            behaviors according to the object immediately in front of the vehicle seen in the video below. Enjoy!</p>

        <h1>Ray Tracing</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="project-update">
            <p>During the spring of 2022, I created a path tracer for my computer graphics class. I started with a 
                raytracer using Peter Shirley's <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a> as a guide.
                After having a good foundation, I implemented a variety of upgrades and features such as direct lighting, indirect lighting with path tracing
                , and multiple importance sampling. Please enjoy a few samples of the results.

        <h1>Shadow Mapping</h1>
        <div class="project-update">
            <h2>What is shadow mapping?</h2>
            <p>Like the name suggests, shadow mapping is a technique used in computer graphics to generate shadows
                Why shadow mapping?
Firstly, shadows make things look more realistic, gives dimensions of depth, and just looks cool.
In ray tracing realistic shadows are much easier to implement, rays are shot from the camera and when they intersect with objects, it is easy to detect if the object is occluded by a light source.
However, given the computing time of ray tracing, how can we get shadows using a rasterizer instead?
This is where shadow mapping comes in. it allows for the real time generation of shadows using a rasterizer.
            </p>

        <div class="project-update">
            <h2>Progress - Part 1</h2>
            <p>First, I created a fragment shader that would color the scene based on depth values. In this case the renderings are from the camera’s 
                Perspective. To generate final image on the right, I had to linearize 
                the depth between two closer points (near and far) to create a nice gradient rather than the image on the left which assigns depth value based off unmodified z-coordinates in window space.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="project-update">
            <h2>Progress - Part 2</h2>
            <p>Since in this project, there is only one light source (the “sun”) which is a directional source as opposed to a point source, I used an orthographic projection for the light’s projection. Using this, I created the left image by rendering the scene with the depth shader fragment from the POV of the Light source (ie. drawing the scene in light space). 
                After this, I combine the two passes by setting up a depth map frame buffer object and depth map, then using the first pass to generate the depth map and store that into a texture. Then passing this texture to the second rendering pass to allow for the calculation of shadows in a separate fragment shader. The right image is a result from this. Next, is to add back in the Phong shading for color. I combined the two by multiplying the shadow (which is 0 for occluded and 1 for not occluded) to the specular and diffuse parts of the Phong shading, the ambient lighting is left alone. 
            </p>

        <div class="project-update">
            <h2>Progress - Part 3 - Dealing with artifacts</h2>
            <p>
                After adding back in the Phong shading, I get the image on the left which contains a shadow mapping artifact called shadow acne. The acne occurs on surfaces not occluded and is caused by the limited resolution of the shadow map and sampling of fragments overlapping. This makes it so that the surface is constant casting a shadow on itself. To fix this, a small bias can be added which offsets the depth of surfaces to make it slightly closer to the light when doing the shadow map comparison. Fixed image is on the right

            </p>
            <img src="./projects/shadow-mapping-images/progress3.0.png">
            <img src="./projects/shadow-mapping-images/progress3.1.png">
            <p>
                Another artifact is aliasing, which causes the edges of shadows to be pixelated and jagged. The method I used to attempt to fix this is called Poisson Sampling. Which essentially samples the depth map multiple times in a small area around  each fragment rather than only sampling the same location
